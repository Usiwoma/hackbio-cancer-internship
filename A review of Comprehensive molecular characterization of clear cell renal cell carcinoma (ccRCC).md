Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is a chemotherapy-resistant kidney cancer. This article analyzed the molecular characterization of ccRCC, explored potential therapeutic targets, and how the alteration of genes influences cell expression levels. The data was obtained from more than 400 tumour specimens. 

**Alterations in VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau) and PBRM1 (Polybromo 1) genes.** 

_VHL_  is a tumour suppressor gene that regulates response to hypoxia and cell growth. Its mutations stabilise the hypoxia-inducible factor proteins promoting tumour growth.

The _PBRM1_ gene regulates gene expression and maintenance of chromatin states. Its mutations affect the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex and disrupt the regulation of genes involved in cell growth, thus contributing to tumour development. 

The loss of chromosome 3p in 91% of samples impacted the VHL and PBRM1 gene, suggesting their significant role in ccRCC development and the study also discovered that VHL and PBRM1 were the most extreme members of ****the significantly mutated genes identified in ccRCC.

The alteration of these genes influences expression levels as follows:

**Epigenetic signalling** - this plays a major role in ccRCC as few of the tumour samples showed VHL could be silenced by epigenetic modifications. This silencing is mutually exclusive with mutations in the VHL gene, highlighting the critical role of VHL in ccRCC progression.

**DNA Methylation-** Increased frequency of DNA promoter hypermethylation correlated with higher stage and grade of ccRCC tumour. Hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes (_VHL_, _PBRM1_) leads to loss of tumour suppression activity, contributing to tumour progression. 

Lastly, integrative data analyses were confirmatory with the Hot Net Algorithm discovering VHL and PBRM1 genes as major genes mutated in ccRCC and the PARADIGM algorithm identifying active transcriptional hubs activated by _VHL_ mutation promote the glycolytic shift and tumour growth in ccRCC.

**PI (3) K/AKT role in ccRCC**

The PI (3) K/AKT pathway is a downstream pathway activated by VHL gene playing a major role in gene regulation and cell metabolism. In this study, the MEMo algorithm identified alterations in this pathway in 28% of ccRCC cases.  

The pathway is altered by reduced AMPK and increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase, with epigenetic drivers like miR-21 further activating the pathway, promoting tumour growth and survival.

**Conclusion**

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is driven by genetic and epigenetic mutations as the review highlights the importance of VHL/HIF pathway, the chromatin remodelling/histone methylation pathway, and the PI(3)K/AKT pathway as potential therapeutic targets for ccRCC.
