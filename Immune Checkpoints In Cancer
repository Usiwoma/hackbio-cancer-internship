Immune checkpoints(ICPs) help the body maintain immune tolerance (Zhai et al., 2021). These receptor-based signal cascades negatively regulate T cells causing immune tolerance allowing tumours to evade immune surveillance (Park et al., 2018). They are placed either on the surface of immune cells or on tumour cells and control the excessive activation of T cells which cause autoimmune damage. (Kamali et al., 2023)

Some immune checkpoints include the cytotoxic tumour lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). CTLA-4 is expressed on regulatory T (Treg) cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Park et al., 2018). PD-1 is expressed on B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. PD-1 binding to its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 prevents T cells from effectively killing tumour cells (Park et al., 2018; Kamali et al., 2023)

**Immune Checkpoints Inhibitors**

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors(ICIs) are cancer immunotherapies that boost anti-cancer immune responses by targeting immunologic receptors on the surface of T-lymphocytes. (Shiravand et al., 2022)

**PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor**- Targeting the PD-1 pathway, has revolutionized cancer treatment with the US FDA approving monoclonal antibodies like Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Cemiplimab as PD-1 inhibitors.  PD-L1 inhibits the cancer-immunity cycle by binding to negative regulators of T-cell activation.

**CTLA-4 inhibitor -** CTLA-4 inhibition improves immunological responses that rely on helper T cells. Ipilimumab inhibits the function of CTLA-4 and is also used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma and other cancers.

**Biomarkers for ICI-Based Immunotherapy** 

Biomarkers increase response to immunotherapy in patients, receiving ICIs. PD-1 is expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and its ligand PD-L1 has been reported as a biomarker for ICI-based immunotherapy. This expression impairs cytotoxic T lymphocyte protection and reduces chronic viral infections (Shiravand et al., 2022). Microsatellite instability status is being studied as a potential biomarker for predicting cancer immunotherapy outcomes. (Shiravand et al., 2022). Lastly, the microbiota in the human body can influence ICI therapy by influencing the immune system. An in vivo study using CT26 tumour-bearing mice revealed that high microbial diversity could affect ICI response efficiently by increasing IL-2 and IFN- secretion when compared to mice given antibiotic injection (Shiravand et al., 2022)

**Conclusion**

The goal of biomarker discovery in the context of immune checkpoints is to enable personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the individual characteristics of each patient's tumour and immune response (Fujii et al., 2018)
